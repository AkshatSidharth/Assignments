        There are two types of moniters available, CRT screen moniters & LCD moniters.Most people are familiar<br> with the fact that monitors come in various resolutions and screen sizes, can have a matte or glossy screen surface and<br> can offer specific features such as 120Hz refresh rates and 3D capabilities. The range of displays and variation <br>in specification can be rather daunting and what’s more; you can’t necessarily trust the ‘on paper’ figures in the first place.<br> One fundamentally important aspect of an LCD monitor which will dictate how it performs and what kind of tasks it<br> would be best at performing is the panel type. Although there are various sub-divisions all modern screens will generally <br>fall into one of three categories with distinct performance characteristics.<br></center>
