Hard Disk are available in all memory in sizesA hard disk drive (HDD) is a data storage device<br> used for storing and retrieving digital information using rapidly rotating disks (platters) <br>coated with magnetic material. An HDD retains its data even when powered off. Data is<br> read in a random-access manner, meaning individual blocks of data can be stored or <br>retrieved in any order rather than sequentially. An HDD consists of one or more rigid ("hard")<br> rapidly rotating disks (platters) with magnetic heads arranged on a moving <br>actuator arm to read and write data to the surfaces.
		Introduced by IBM in 1956, HDDs became the dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose<br> computers by the early 1960s. Continuously improved, HDDs have maintained this position into the modern<br> era of servers and personal computers. More than 200 companies have produced HDD units, though most curren<br>t units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba and Western Digital. Worldwide disk storage revenues were US $32 billion in 2013, down 3% from 2012.
The primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity and performance. Capacity is specified in unit prefixes corresponding to powers of 1000: a 1-terabyte (TB) drive has a capacity of 1,000 gigabytes (GB; where 1 gigabyte = 1 billion bytes). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the file system and<br> the computer operating system, and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error <br>correction and recovery. Performance is specified by the time to move the heads to a file <br>(average access time) plus the time it takes for the file to move under its head (average latency, a function of the physical rotational speed in revolutions per minute) and the speed at which the file is <br>transmitted (data rate).
		The two most common form factors for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch in desktop computers and 2.5-inch in laptops. HDDs are connected to systems by<br> standard interface cables such as SATA (Serial ATA), USB or SAS (Serial attached SCSI) cables.
